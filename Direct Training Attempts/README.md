# Direct Training Attempts
We group our training attempts for SNN Regression by directly training the SNN here. 

All of these training notebooks are based on the code found here https://snntorch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_regression_1.html

This code is based on the following two papers:

[Alexander Henkes, Jason K. Eshraghian, and Henning Wessels. “Spiking neural networks for nonlinear regression”, arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.03515, October 2022.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03515)
